# Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection
This script detects fraudulent transactions from a dataset in `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection` using K-Means clustering and visualizes the results. It includes preprocessing steps, outlier detection, normalization, and fraud detection logic based on distances from cluster centroids.

## **Libraries Used**
- **tidyverse:** For data manipulation and visualization.
- **caret:** For preprocessing.
- **cluster:** For clustering algorithms.
- **factoextra:** For visualizing clustering results.

## **Note**
This project was used to identify anomalies based in data patterns.
