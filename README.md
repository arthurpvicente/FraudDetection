# Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from a bank transaction dataset using K-Means clustering. The dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection).

## Project Description
This project uses K-Means clustering to identify anomalies in bank transaction data, which may indicate fraudulent activity. The results are visualized to provide insights into the clustering process and the detected anomalies.

## Libraries Used
- tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.
- caret: For preprocessing.
- cluster: For clustering algorithms.
- factoextra: For visualizing clustering results.

## Installation
To set up the environment and install the necessary libraries, run the following commands in RStudio:

```r
# Install necessary packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("cluster")
install.packages("factoextra")
```
---

## Usage
To run the script and detect fraudulent transactions, use the following command in RStudio:

```r
# Source the script
source("path/to/your/script.R")
```
